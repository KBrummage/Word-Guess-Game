# Word-Guess-Game
This is an adaptation of the famous childhood word guess game, hangman.  This is not the type of game that would be fostered in elementary schools these days!  That being said, it is a game where you guess the letters.  Each time you make the wrong choice, a representation of a limb is drawn on a person who is most obviously noose-bound.  Make sure to make the right guess, so as not to get "hung up" on a word!


There is an object with 12 key/value pairs.  One is designated "name" and  list of names of tech companies that are used as the clues.  The other is "slogan" with -you guessed it!- the motto (official or otherwise) of the respective company.  

When you hit the button, of of the 12 saved pieces of the object is selected, the motto is shown, and you see the letters, represented as underscores.  You can type or click the alphabetic buttons to guess.  When you get the word right w/o using all six strikes, the win tally increases by one.  If you use all six strikes without guessing the word, the loss tally increases by one.

Simple, right?
